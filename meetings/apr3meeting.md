# Things to discuss with the new TA
- How is our LRM?
- Is our language too easy?
  - Where to improve if that's the case?
    - provide more syntax choices for matrix/vector? http://simit-lang.org/language#Literals


Check how you implement the printf problem...
Printing boolean...

Codegen

LRM includes all the grammars...
Examples are helpful.

Grammer is more formal...
But also the regular expressions...

Get rid of vectors...

m[x][y]
user have correct dimension...
we can do a lot of checkings...
make sure that the index is less than the length of the matrix 

check the index of that access...
SEMANT

use case

inverse...
adding to matrix...

all the basic calculation of matrix...
tuple! just use the tuple...
not common feature mutiple return value (not easy to implement...) (Have time -> Try!!!)


(HARD in sematic check!)
(MAke some work)
